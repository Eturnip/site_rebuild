**Global Game Jam 2013**

Over this past weekend I had the honor of working with this talented and dedicated team of people. From the looks of this picture we are all well hydrated.   
  
In just shy of 48 hours we met, came up with an idea, learned some new tools, and put ideas and tools together to make a game. Or at least the strong beginnings of a game.   
  
You can download and play the game [o](http://globalgamejam.org/2013/mortuus-cor)n the [Global Game Jam site](http://globalgamejam.org/2013/mortuus-cor) (currently windows only) and find out some more about the people that made it. Put on your headphones, turn out the lights, and _enjoy_ [Mortuus Cor](http://globalgamejam.org/2013/mortuus-cor).
