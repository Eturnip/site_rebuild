<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph" style='text-align:left;'>I &nbsp;just put up a new build of&nbsp;<a href="../stuff/TurboGarbageTruck/index.html" style="" title="">TurboGarbageTruck</a>. This is easily the most broken build I've put out since the very first tests. It's also one of the most interesting, as far as I'm concerned. There are a few things that I've been working on in different experiments that have gelled together in this build. That it functions, on even the most basic level, is enough for me to call this a success.<br><br>Forward we go.<br></div>
