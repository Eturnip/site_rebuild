<div class="blog-content">
				<div class="paragraph" style='text-align:left;'>I set up the resource gauges today. I'm one step closer to this actually being a game rather than some odd widget. Pretty soon here I will go into some detail about what I'm building. I'll probably just post up the link to the dev versions and let folks bang on it. The grand experiment would be to just do game development with the kimono wide open . Really give away all the details... I'm not sure if I have worked up the courage for that just yet.<br><br>I'll think about it.</div>
