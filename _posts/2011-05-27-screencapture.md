				<div class="paragraph" style='text-align:left;'>I finally got my screen capture software to work properly.<br><br>Here is a quick test I did to make sure I could capture any concept work.<br><br></div>  <div style='margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:10px;'><div style="text-align: center;"><object width="400" height="330"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/lYZZXHR7Q_E"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><param name="allownetworking" value="internal"><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/lYZZXHR7Q_E" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allownetworking="internal" wmode="transparent" width="400" height="330"></object></div></div>  <div class="paragraph" style='text-align:left;'><br>I sped it up quite a bit, because nothing is more dull than watching someone draw a poor sketch for a long time.<br><br>I'll be trying to capture any concept and modelling I do. The sketches will likely be better, but I'll still try to keep the videos short.<br><br>Is there anything that anyone would be&nbsp;particularly&nbsp;interested in seeing a video of? Would commentary be good?<br><br>Also, fresh builds are always going up. Go test it out. There is some sound now and the truck is much harder to flip.<br></div>
